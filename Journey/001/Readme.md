# Get initiation to Github and learn about basic Cloud Concepts.

## Introduction

This is my journey to completing AZ-900 certification and know all I can about cloud technology.

## Prerequisite

This begennier level cloud conecpts cert.

## Cloud Research

Last two days I struggled to find time and focus to begin my journey, but from today I will commit time to my journey.So far I have managed to create a 100daysofcloud journey template. For someone coming from product, this is the first time I am using github for more than just change approvals process so it has been trial and error.I will try and attempt to use visual code for my updates to the template (like GPS demonstrated in her video) as it will give me a closer experience of what developers go through day to day.


### Step 1 — Summary of Step
I have in the last 3 days competed the "Cloud Concepts - Principles of cloud computing" 10 modules.
